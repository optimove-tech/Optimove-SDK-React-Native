# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- iOS: Fixed duplicate interface definition error for `OptimoveInitializer` when building with React Native 0.79.6+
  - Removed redundant `OptimoveInitializer.h` header file (Swift's `@objc` attribute auto-generates the interface)
  - Updated AppDelegate import to use auto-generated Swift header
  - **Migration**: Update your AppDelegate.mm import:
    ```objective-c
    // Old (v3.0.0):
    #import <OptimoveReactNative/OptimoveInitializer.h>
    
    // New:
    #if __has_include(<OptimoveReactNative/OptimoveReactNative-Swift.h>)
    #import <OptimoveReactNative/OptimoveReactNative-Swift.h>
    #elif __has_include("OptimoveReactNative-Swift.h")
    #import "OptimoveReactNative-Swift.h"
    #endif
    ```
